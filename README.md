# transformer-model
A Tensorflow implementation of the transformer deep learning model, based on the research paper "[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)" (Vaswani et al., 2017). The official implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor).


The implementation follows the model architecture from the original work:
